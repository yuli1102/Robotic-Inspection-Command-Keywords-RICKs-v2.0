•	Processed data
This file shows how we convert the raw “.mat” data into the final data files we used for classification. 
1.	Data Segmentation (example code can be found in Segmentation_Example.ipynb”)
1)	Extract the audio data apart from the raw “.mat” data. Extracted audio data can be found here.
2)	Split data on silence by setting a minimum silence time, silence threshold, and a segment length. 
3)	Assign labels of Train, Val, and Test to each segment. Get a Alignment csv file, which can be found as “Alignment_label_final.csv”
2.	Convert to Image (example code can be found in Convert_Scaleogram_Example.ipynb”)
1)	Use scaleogram package to generate the scaleogram 
2)	The final converted scaleogram can be found here.
